Please implement an efficient closest point on mesh query in C++.

Requirements:
- You may use any supporting libraries you like to provide C++ memory management, containers, geometry types
(mesh, point, uv), etc however the core algorithm must be implemented explicitly.

- Implementation should be efficient for repeated point queries on a particular mesh

- List any assumptions required.

- Please provide any design notes, tests, (generated) documentation etc that would assist others maintaining your code.

A possible interface is:

class ClosestPointQuery
{
public:
ClosestPointQuery(const Mesh& m);

//! Return the closest point to the mesh within the specified
maximum search distance.

Point operator() (const Point& queryPoint, float maxDist) const;

};
